I want to first build a spider using scrapy that gets the top twiter profiles from a list on a website which also provides their twitter handles, then I want to get all of their tweets (if possible without rate limiting), and use NLTK to get the most common words they tweet. 
Website with list: http://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/
